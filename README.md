# Dummy MERN Project
This was built using [Net Ninja's tutorial on the MERN stack]([https://www.example.com](https://youtu.be/98BzS5Oz5E4?si=k3D3Oxs3uPBSG8EU)). The main motivation behind it was for me to learn and play around
with this tech stack! 

I was reluctant to make this repo public because I feel like it's sometimes looked down upon to 
make a project following a youtube tutorial, but I think it's cool to be honest about where we start our journey as developers
and I thought this repo could give other newbies an idea of what a bare-bones MERN app looks like. 

## To start-up
This assumes that you have already downloaded react and nodemon and express and node. If you don't, search up the commands for downloading these, it's fairly straight-forward!

Download the code, open up in an IDE, open up terminal into the backend folder, then type "npm run dev" and hit enter.

Then open up terminal into the frontend folder and type "npm start", then hit enter.

The app should open up in your browser!
